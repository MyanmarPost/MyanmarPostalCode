# About Postal Code

The postal code is a combination of **Seven Numbers**, which define four different levels of geographic unit. It is part of a coding system created and used by the Myanmar Post for sorting mail. The postal codes are an abbreviated form of address, which enable a group of delivery points (a delivery point being a property or business locations) to be specifically identified.

# Postal Code Defination
- Each postal code consists of three parts. The first part is the state or region code. 
- The second postal code enables mail to be sent to the correct local area for delivery.
This part of the code contains the town and township district to which the mail is to be
delivered.
- The final postal code is used to sort the mail at the local area delivery office. It
consists of three numeric character followed by town and township area. The numeric
character identifies the sector within the postal district. The last three number define quarter or village tract within the sector.
