# About Postal Code

The postal code is a combination of **Seven Numbers**, which define three different levels of geographical unit. It is part of a coding system created and used by the Myanmar Post for sorting mail. The postal codes are an abbreviated form of address, which enable a group of delivery points (a delivery point being a property or business location) to be specifically identified.
